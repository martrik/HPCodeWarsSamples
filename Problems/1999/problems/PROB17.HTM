<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Point Value: 15</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Problem Statement</font></b>
<p>The FAA regulates and restricts air flight in certain regions, especially
near airports.&nbsp; Each airport has an air traffic control tower that
controls the airspace within a designated region.&nbsp; A pilot who enters
a controlled airspace must usually communicate with the tower, possibly
changing frequencies while flying through that airspace.&nbsp; In this
problem we'll write a program to determine which air spaces are entered
by a specific flight plan.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reality: </font></b>In reality, air
traffic control spaces have irregular 3D shapes.&nbsp; Reality is also
quite complex in that our planet is apparently spherical.&nbsp; I haven't
actually observed this myself, but it is a well accepted postulate.&nbsp;
It certainly makes the math for this problem quite a bit harder than I
want it to be.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Simplicity:</font></b> For simplicity,
we'll model this complex reality by oversimplifying.&nbsp; <i>Radically</i>
oversimplifying.&nbsp; First, we'll assume that we can map longitude and
latitude to miles in a linear fashion.&nbsp; This is patently untrue, and
will make our results wholly inaccurate.&nbsp; But this is only a contest.&nbsp;
To make our results a little more meaningful, we will restrict our map
of sites to Texas, because Texas is fairly flat, heh, heh.&nbsp; Based
on our first assumption we'll also assume that flight paths are straight
lines in a rectangular (longitude, latitude) coordinate system.&nbsp; Next
we'll define the controlled airspace as a vertical cylinder with the control
tower at the center.&nbsp; Finally, based on our first wildly inaccurate
assumption, we'll convert degrees to miles using the following formulae:
<center>MILES&nbsp; =&nbsp; 50.23 * DEGREES LONGITUDE
<br>MILES&nbsp; =&nbsp; 60.07 * DEGREES LATITUDE</center>

<p>The program should read a data file describing all these controller
air spaces.&nbsp; The program will then read an aircraft departure and
destination from a separate file.&nbsp; Finally, the program will write
the names of all of the air spaces through which the aircraft must fly
in order of their occurrence.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Program Input</font></b>
<p>The file AIRSPACE.DAT contains six lines of text for each air traffic
control tower.&nbsp; Each airport data block contains the name of the airport,
the tower's longitude and latitude in degrees, and the radius of that tower's
controlled air space in miles.&nbsp; All airports are located in Texas
(mostly!).&nbsp; The names and locations of the airports are accurate,
but the tower control radius figures are fictional for this problem.&nbsp;
Here are some sample lines for a single airport:
<p><tt>Airport Name: GEORGE BUSH INTCNTL HOUSTON</tt>
<br><tt>IATA: IAH</tt>
<br><tt>Location: HOUSTON, TX, UNITED STATES</tt>
<br><tt>Latitude: 29&ordm; 58' N</tt>
<br><tt>Longitude: 95&ordm; 20' W</tt>
<br><tt>Radius: 25 MILES</tt>
<p>After reading the airspace data file, the program should read a series
of flight paths from the input file PROB17.IN.&nbsp; Each line of the input
file contains (1) the IATA codes for the departure and arrival locations,
in that order, (2) the departure time in 24 hr format, and (3) the average
aircraft speed in miles/hour.&nbsp; For example:
<p><tt>SAT IAH 08:14 120MPH</tt>
<br><tt>DFW SAT 08:14 120MPH</tt>
<br><tt>ELP IAH 17:53 185MPH</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Program Output</font></b>
<p>The program should write the results to the output file PROB17.OUT.&nbsp;
For each flight plan, the program should write the IATA codes for the departure
and arrival airports on a single line.&nbsp; Then it must print the names
of the airports through whose airspace the aircraft will fly.&nbsp; The
airports should be listed in the order they will be crossed in flight.&nbsp;
The actual departure and arrival should be considered separate "intersections"
as shown in the example output.&nbsp; For each airport print (1) the airport
name, (2) the name of the city where the airport is located, (3) the longitude
and latitude of the intersection between the flight path and the airspace.&nbsp;
Note that some air spaces overlap the towers of other airports.&nbsp; All
airspace's which include the flight path must be reported.&nbsp; For example,
the output for the first input line above is:
<p><tt>From: SAT&nbsp;&nbsp; To: IAH</tt>
<br><tt>DEPART: SAN ANTONIO INTL(SAT)</tt>

<p><b>2 POINT BONUS:</b> In addition to the requirements above, the program
should also display (1) the average speed on the first line, (2) the prompt
ENTER or EXIT instead of CROSS, and (3) the estimated time at which the
aircraft enters and exits each controlled airspace (assuming the aircraft
maintains the average speed throughout the entire flight).&nbsp; Times
should be displayed in the same 24 hr format as the input.&nbsp; The same
example input flight plan would yield this result:
<p><tt>From: SAT&nbsp;&nbsp; To: IAH&nbsp;&nbsp; AvgSpeed:&nbsp;&nbsp;
